# Moving Eyes
This Moving Eyes exercise contains code for setting up two eyes that follow a mouse cursor as it moves around the screen. The eyes move in tandem with one another.

## How To Run
In order to run this code after cloning the repo, open index.html in a browser. From there, move your mouse cursor within the browser screen and the eyes will follow the movement.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
In the future, the hope is to improve on this project with the addition of other interactive components to help form a face around the eyes. For example, a mouth that smiles and frowns depending on where the mouse is on the screen. Another potential improvement includes adding more responses to the eyes themselves, namely having them open and close when the mouse clicks on them.
